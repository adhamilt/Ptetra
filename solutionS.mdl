! rho(i) net charge density at vertex i
! phi(i): scalar potential at vertex i
! phiPar(i): scalar potential for the particular solution (with the volume
!            charge density and the potential set to zero on all structures
! rhoAv: average value of rho, as calculated with tauAv
! tauAv: time over which field averages are to be calculated. The averages
!        approximate int(-inf,t){field(t')exp(-(t-t')/tauAv) dt'} / tauAv
!        no average is made if tauAv<=0.
! wAvCumul: cumulated weight used for calculating the average
! Jxyz(i,j): vector array of the xyz (i=1,2,3) components of the current

! JxyzAv(i,j): Average value of jxyz, as calculated with tauAv
! Bxyz(i,j): component (i=1-3) of the perturbed magnetic field at vertex j.
