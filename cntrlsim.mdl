module cntrlsim
! ntmax: maximum number of time steps
! tstop: maximum simulation time
! dtrdm: number of timesteps between writing a restart file
! dtdia: number of timesteps between writing diagnostic files
! dt: time step
! time: time
! epsildt: scaling factor used to set dt (should be < 1.)
! timestep: timestep into the simulation
! nepercell: target number of electrons in the smallest cell.
!            If negative (default), the number of electrons is taken to be
!            netotIni
! netotIni: total initial number of electrons, only used if nepercell <=0.
! speedup: numerical speedup factor for pushing electrons. each time step
!          electrons are pushed over a period dt/speedup. indoing so, it
!          is important to integrate electron currents over a full period dt
! rdmfmt: true or false to produce (and read) formatted or unformatted
!         restart files.
! restartfrom: name of files from which to restart.
!              "null" for no restart.
! outputformat: 'topo' to save in topo format. In all cases, output is also
!               saved in Vu format
